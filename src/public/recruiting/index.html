    <p>If you are interested in joining the MaPLE lab and associated group meetings, please reach out to the lab directly. If you are interested in being advised by me (<a href="https://uvm.edu/%7Eetosch">Emma Tosch</a>) in some capacity, please navigate to the appropriate section and read through the text first:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://uvm-maple.github.io/recruiting/#graduate-students">You are a current or soon-to-be graduate student at UVM or elsewhere</a></li>

<h1 id="graduate-students">Graduate Students</h1>
<p>&quot;Recruiting&quot; in academia typically refers to the process of taking on PhD students and hiring non-PhD researchers. Recruitment is often tied to grant funding. <em>At present, I am not <em>actively</em> recruiting new graduate students, since all of my grants are fully staffed vis a vis graduate students.</em> If you would like to be advised by me, you may need to start in the TA pool for a bit. </p>
<p>I am, however, <em>always</em> interested in <strong>working with</strong> motivated and inquisitive students of any background. If you are already a graduate student at UVM and have a specific research project in mind, please feel free to reach out for a meeting. If you are interested in my research perspective more broadly, consider enrolling in one of my courses. If you are interested in the MaPLE lab, reach out to us about attending lab meetings and reading groups. </p>
<p>I am always interested in collaborations with graduate students at any institution and if there is a promising research direction that might come out of a collaboration, I will happily write a grant to fund student research. I feel very strongly that students should be paid for their work, but if you need the credits, I can work with you on research for credit. </p>
<p>If you are generally interested in PhD programs, please be on the lookout for my annual inter-university <a href="https://phd-recruiting.com">PhD recruiting event</a>. I generally take a labor-focused view of research, treating the advisor-advisee relationship as an <em>apprenticeship</em> where I focus on treating research as <em>work</em>. I have an active informal research project on working conditions for graduate students across universities, which includes an ongoing survey of graduate student salaries and benefits:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now is probably a good time to note that I&#39;m still collecting data for my informal survey of CS[-ish] PhD salaries. If you are a current student, consider filling it out! <a href="https://t.co/501TbPU2sx">https://t.co/501TbPU2sx</a></p>&mdash; Emma Tosch, not a thought leader. (@ToschEmma) <a href="https://twitter.com/ToschEmma/status/1352094659909214212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>I have paid my graduate student researchers the following rates and try to keep up with inflation. There will always be delays and potential funding gaps, so I encourage my students to communicate early and often about an financial issues before they have the opportunity to interfere with research. Here are my historic rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>AY 2021-2022: $30.00/hr</li>
<li>AY 2022-2023: $32.10/hr </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="undergraduate-students">Undergraduate Students</h1>
<p>Undergraduate students who are interested in working with me should email me directly. I am happy to support undergraduate studnets on funded projects via REU funds. Since funded projects are often changing, discussing opportunities synchronously with me is the best course of action. If you would like to do summer research with me from any institution, please reach out and I will find a way to make that happen. </p>
<p>If you are a UVM student with a specific thesis project in mind, I <em>strongly</em> encourage you to take one of my courses first. If you cannot take my courses, I encourage you to attend lab meetings for one semester before your prospective start date. I <em>cannot</em> advise thesis projects outside my expertise. Thesis projects need not be research, but they should be related to a topic I can advise on. This will prevent any mismatches in expectations for both parties. </p>
