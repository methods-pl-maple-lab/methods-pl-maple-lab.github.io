Depending on the specific work they do, students may find the following topics especially helpful. I've additionally included courses at UVM that appear to provide foundational material for some of the techniques we use in MaPLE; I do not know the content of courses I do not teach, so I cannot vouch for them. The self-study material I can either vouch for myself or has come recommended by someone I trust.

_Note:_ [UVM CS 295 &mdash; Artificial Intelligence](https://uvm-maple.github.io/CS295A-S22/) covered logic and probabilistic modeling, while [UVM CS 295 &mdash; System Design for Knowledge Discovery](https://uvm-maple.github.io/CS295B-F21/) covered some background on DSLs. However, these courses are in flux and the amount of content from this list of topics that they contain is likely to change, since neither are explicitly about these topics.
