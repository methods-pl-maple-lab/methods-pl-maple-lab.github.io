The Methods and Programming Languages for Experimentation (MaPLE) lab focuses on applying techniques from formal methods and programming languages to data collection instruments, with a focus on experiments.   We are a _methodology_ lab and our research focuses on questions of _how_ we know whether researchers and the general public can trust research results. 

We have particular focus on the following topics:

* Explainability 
* Causality
* Reproducibility

The focus of this lab is on applying _formal methods_ and _programming language design_ to programs not ordinarily thought of as code:
